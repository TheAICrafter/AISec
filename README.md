# AISec
Welcome to the repository for **AISec(temp name)**, an innovative and energy-efficient home security system powered by cutting-edge AI technologies. This project combines advanced machine learning models, edge computing, and local data processing to create a smart, private, and highly effective security solution.

## Key Features

### 1. **Advanced Network Segmentation**
- **Three Isolated VLANs:**
  - **VLAN 1:** Home network for general devices (computers, phones, smart devices).
  - **VLAN 2 (Security Zone):** Fully offline, hosting cameras, AI models, and processing units.
  - **VLAN 3 (Gateway):** A physically separated Raspberry Pi handling external communication, including notifications and software updates, with strict firewall rules and 2FA-protected VPN access.
- **Security First:** Communication between VLANs is strictly controlled and time-limited, ensuring maximum protection against intrusions.

### 2. **AI-Driven Insights**
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Models detect, classify, and track objects, distinguishing between humans, animals, and vehicles.
- **Facial Recognition:** Limited to close-range interactions, ensuring privacy while providing convenience for family members.
- **Geofencing Integration:** System behavior adapts dynamically based on location data, reducing false alarms.

### 3. **Energy Efficiency**
- **Optimized Edge AI:** Combining pruning, quantization, and sparsity techniques to minimize resource usage.
- **Smart Workflows:** A Coral accelerator handles initial detections, waking the Jetson Orin only when necessary for deeper analysis.
- **Local Data Storage:** All data processing and storage occur locally, significantly reducing energy and environmental impact.

### 4. **Privacy by Design**
- **GDPR Compliance:** Data is anonymized before being used for model training, ensuring ethical AI practices.
- **Incident Data:** Critical incidents (e.g., intrusion attempts) are securely stored on a local NAS for future reference.
